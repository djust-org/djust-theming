"""
Per-theme modules — one file per built-in theme.

Each theme file (e.g., bauhaus.py, dracula.py) contains all pieces for
that theme: color preset (PRESET), design system (DESIGN_SYSTEM), and
theme pack (PACK).

This package also re-exports the deprecated Theme/THEMES API from
_legacy.py for backward compatibility.
"""

# Re-export legacy themes.py API so that existing code like
# `from djust_theming.themes import Theme, get_theme, THEMES`
# continues to work now that themes/ is a package.
